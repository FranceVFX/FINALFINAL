# Vercel Web Analytics Configuration

Successfully configured Vercel Web Analytics for this Next.js App Router project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
- The `@vercel/analytics` package (v1.6.1) was already present in package.json
- Ran `pnpm install` to ensure all dependencies were properly installed
- Generated `pnpm-lock.yaml` lockfile for dependency consistency

### 2. Updated Root Layout (app/layout.tsx)
- Changed import from `@vercel/analytics/react` to `@vercel/analytics/next`
- This is the correct import path for Next.js App Router projects
- The `<Analytics />` component was already properly placed inside the `<body>` tag

### 3. Added Analytics to Frontend Layout (src/app/(frontend)/layout.tsx)
- Imported Analytics component from `@vercel/analytics/next`
- Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag, after the `</Providers>` closing tag
- This ensures analytics tracking for all frontend pages

## Implementation Details

The project uses Next.js App Router with route groups:
- `app/layout.tsx` - Root layout (already had Analytics, updated import path)
- `src/app/(frontend)/layout.tsx` - Frontend layout (added Analytics)
- `src/app/(payload)/layout.tsx` - Payload CMS admin layout (no Analytics needed as it's auto-generated)

## Verification

✅ Build completed successfully with no errors
✅ Linter ran successfully with no new warnings
✅ All changes follow Next.js App Router best practices
✅ Analytics component properly placed in both layout files

## Files Modified

1. `app/layout.tsx` - Updated Analytics import path
2. `src/app/(frontend)/layout.tsx` - Added Analytics component and import
3. `pnpm-lock.yaml` - Generated/updated lockfile

The implementation follows Vercel's official documentation for Next.js App Router integration.
